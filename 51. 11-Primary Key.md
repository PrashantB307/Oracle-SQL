###  Generating Primary Key Using Trigger ====>
===============================================


## Step 1: Creating The Table

* For the purpose of creating a primary key for a table, first we must CREATE the table as shown below-

CREATE TABLE books (
id NUMBER(10) constraint BK_ID_PK Primary Key,
title VARCHAR2(100));

## Step 2: Creating A Sequence

* The next step is to create a SEQUENCE in our database, which will automatically generate incremented values, as shown below:

CREATE SEQUENCE books_sequence;

## Step 3: Creating The Trigger

* While we have our table created and ready to go, our sequence is thus far just sitting there but never being put to use.

* This is where TRIGGERS come in.

* We can write a TRIGGER to execute just prior to INSERT into our BOOKS table, ensuring our SEQUENCE is incremented and that new value is passed onto our primary key column.

## Step 3: Creating The Trigger

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER books_on_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON books
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SELECT books_sequence.nextval
    INTO :new.id FROM dual;
END;
