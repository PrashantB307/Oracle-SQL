###  Introduction To Trigger ====>
==================================

* Triggers in Oracle are blocks of PL/SQL code which Oracle engine can execute automatically based on some action or event.

* These events can be:
- DDL statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE)
- DML statements (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Database operation like connecting or disconnecting to Oracle (LOGON, LOGOFF, SHUTDOWN)


##  Uses Of Trigger ===>
========================

* Following are use cases where using triggers proves very helpful:
- Maintaining complex constraints which is either impossible or very difficult via normal constraint(like primary, foreign, unique etc) applying technique.
- Recording the changes made on the table.
- Automatically generating primary key values.


# Syntax ==>

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE | AFTER
INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE
    ON table_name
    [FOR EACH ROW]
DECLARE
    Declaration-statements
BEGIN
    Executable-statements
EXCEPTION
    Exception-handling-statements
END; 

* Following is the explanation of statements that are present in trigger creation.
- BEFORE/ AFTER will specify the event timings.
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/etc. will specify the event for which the triggerneeds to be fired.
- ON clause will specify on which object the above-mentioned event is valid. Forexample, this will be the table name on which the DML event may occur in the case of DML Trigger.
- Command "FOR EACH ROW" will specify the ROW level trigger.
- The declaration part, execution part, exception handling part is same as that of the other PL/SQL blocks. Declaration part and exception handling part are optional.


## Trigger Pseudo Variables ===>
================================

* In a row level trigger, the trigger fires for each related row.

* And sometimes it is required to know the column values of the effected row before and after the DML statement.

* Oracle has provided two clauses in the ROW-level trigger to hold these values. We can use these clauses to refer to the old and new values inside the trigger body.

* ` :NEW ` – It holds a new value for the columns of the base table/view during the trigger execution

* ` :OLD ` – It holds old value of the columns of the base table/view during the trigger execution.


## Rules Regarding :new And :old ==>
====================================

* If the trigger is an after trigger then we cannot change any field value of :new

* We can change the field values of :new for before trigger but it is not allowed for :old


## Exercise ==>

# Create a trigger called checkprice that prevents users from updating or inserting any record in ALLBOOKS table with bookprice other than the range 500 to 700.

create or replace trigger checkprice
before insert or update
on allbooks
for each row
begin
    if :new.bookprice not between 500 and 700 then
        raise_application_error(-20001, 'Bookprice cannot be other than 500 to 700');
    end if;
end checkprice;


# Create a trigger called checkday that prevents users from updating or inserting any record in EMP table with hiredate that falls on weekends.

create or replace trigger checkday
before insert or update
on emp
for each row
begin
    if to_char(:new.hiredate,'DY') in ('SAT','SUN') then
        raise_application_error(-20001,' Hiring is not done on weekends');
    end if;
end checkday;


## Performing Audit Trail ===>
==============================

* Trigger can also be used to perform audit trail on tables.

* For example , if a record is deleted from a table then we can use a trigger to save the details of the deleted record to another table.

# Example ==>

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER books_audit_trg
AFTER DELETE ON allbooks
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audits (bookid, transaction_name, by_user, transaction_date) 
    VALUES(:old.book_id,’DELETE’ , USER, SYSDATE);
END;


##  Triggering Flags ===>
=========================

* When a trigger is defined for multiple DML events, Oracle provides us three flags called INSERTING , UPDATING and DELETING.

* One of them becomes true depending on the triggering event.

* So , event-specific code can be defined using the INSERTING, UPDATING, DELETING flags.


# Modify the previous trigger so that if update is issued then also it records that.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER books_audit_trg
AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON allbooks
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    trans VARCHAR2(10);
BEGIN
    if UPDATING then
        trans:=‘UPDATE’;
    else
        trans:=‘DELTETE’;
    end if;
    INSERT INTO audits (bookid, transaction_name, by_user,
    transaction_date) VALUES(:old.book_id,trans, USER, SYSDATE);
END;


##  Statement Level Trigger ===>
================================

* A statement-level trigger is fired whenever a triggering event occurs on a table regardless of how many rows are affected.

* In other words, a statement-level trigger executes once for each transaction.

* For example, if we update 1000 rows in a table, then a statement-level trigger on that table would only be executed once.

* Due to its features, a statement-level trigger is not often used for data-related activities like auditing the changes of the data in the associated table.

* It’s typically used to enforce extra security measures on the kind of transaction that may be performed on a table.


## Create A Statement Level Trigger ===>
=======================================

* By default, the statement CREATE TRIGGER creates a statementlevel trigger when we omit the FOR EACH ROW clause.

# Syntax:

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE | AFTER | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE
    ON table_name
DECLARE
    Declaration-statements
BEGIN
    Executable-statements
EXCEPTION
    Exception-handling-statements
END; 

# Exercise ==>

create or replace trigger allbookstr
before insert
on allbooks
declare
    today number(3);
begin
    today: to_number(to_char(sysdate, 'DD'));
    if today between 15 and 20 then
        raise_application_error(-20002,'New books are not added from 15 to 20');
    end if; 
end allbookstr;


##  Instead Of Trigger ===>
===========================

* An INSTEAD OF trigger is a trigger that allows us to update data in tables via their view which cannot be modified directly through DML statements.

* When we issue a DML statement such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to a non-updatable view, then Oracle will issue an error.

* If the view has an INSTEAD OF trigger, it will automatically skip the DML statement and execute the DML statements defined in trigger

* Note that an INSTEAD OF trigger is fired for each row of the view that gets modified.

* In Oracle, we can create an INSTEAD OF trigger for a view only and not for a table.

# Syntax

CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name
INSTEAD OF INSERT or UPDATE or DELETE
ON view_name
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
BEGIN
EXCEPTION
END;

# Example

CREATE VIEW staff
AS
SELECT emp.emp_name,dept.dept_name,dept.location
FROM emp,dept
WHERE emp.dept_no=dept.dept_no;
